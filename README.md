# Grids
Codes related to structured/unstructured grids for FVM or FEM, conversions of grids from one to other format:

1) naca_BL_hybrid.geo
   This is the geo script to be run in gmsh. This script generates 2D mesh around NACA0012 airfoil with boundary layer. 
  Mesh generated will also be dense in the wake region for good resolution.
